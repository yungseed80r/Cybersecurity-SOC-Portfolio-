- `Lab_Setup_Guide.md`
- `Network_Topology.png`


**Focus:** Virtual lab deployment, system hardening, and testing simulations.

**Objective:**  
Design and configure a personal cybersecurity lab to simulate enterprise networks, perform vulnerability assessments, and develop SOC workflows.

**Summary:**  
This artifact documents the setup and configuration of a hands-on cybersecurity lab environment built with **VirtualBox**, **Kali Linux**, **Metasploitable 2**, and **Splunk**.  
It includes network segmentation, host configuration, and baseline logging setup for realistic offensive and defensive exercises.  
The lab provides the technical foundation for vulnerability scanning, incident response, and security monitoring simulations across other artifacts.
