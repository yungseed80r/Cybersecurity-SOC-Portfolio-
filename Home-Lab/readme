**Focus:** Virtual lab deployment, baseline logging, and hands-on SOC simulations.

**Objective:**  
Design and configure a personal cybersecurity lab to simulate enterprise networks, perform vulnerability assessments, and develop SOC workflows.

**Summary:**  
This artifact documents a multi-VM lab built with **VirtualBox**, **Kali Linux**, **Metasploitable 2**, and **Splunk**.  
It covers network segmentation, host configuration, and baseline logging to support realistic attack/defense scenarios.  
The lab underpins practical exercises across the portfolio, including vulnerability scanning, SIEM analysis, and incident response.
