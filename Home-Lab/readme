### 5. Home Lab Environment

**Objective:**  
Design and configure a personal cybersecurity lab to simulate enterprise networks, perform testing, and develop hands-on SOC skills.

**Artifacts:**  
- Lab Setup Guide  
- Network Topology Diagram  
- Configuration and Testing Notes

**Summary:**  
This artifact illustrates the ability to build and manage a multi-VM lab using **VirtualBox**, **Kali Linux**, **Metasploitable 2**, and **Splunk**.  
It documents system provisioning, segmentation, and baseline configurations to ensure realistic attack-and-defense simulations.  
The environment serves as the foundation for practical exercises in vulnerability management, incident response, and threat analysis.
