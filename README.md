## ðŸ“Œ About This Portfolio  
This portfolio demonstrates my practical, hands-on cybersecurity skills through real-world simulations and SOC-style investigations.  
Each project focuses on detecting, analyzing, and responding to potential security incidents using tools and techniques common in professional environments.  

The portfolio builds upon my GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance) experience and showcases my technical readiness for entry-level cybersecurity or SOC Analyst roles.
