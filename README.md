# 🛡️ Cybersecurity SOC Portfolio  
### by Alexander T. Ramos

**Objective:**  
Showcase practical, hands-on cybersecurity skills across SOC disciplines including log analysis, vulnerability management, phishing investigation, incident response, and home lab simulation.  
All artifacts reflect real-world workflows aligned with **NIST 800-61**, **NIST 800-53**, and **MITRE ATT&CK** frameworks.

## 📂 Portfolio Artifacts (Alphabetical Order)

### 🧩 Artifact 5 – Home Lab Environment  
**Folder:** `Home-Lab`

**Deliverables:**
- `Home_Lab_Report_Alexander_Ramos.pdf`
- `Lab_Setup_Guide.md`
- `Network_Topology.png`

**Focus:** Virtual cybersecurity lab architecture.  
**Summary:** Designed a multi-VM environment using **VirtualBox**, **Kali Linux**, and **Metasploitable 2**, with **Splunk** as a SIEM for testing, scanning, and training workflows.  
Serves as the foundation for SOC exercises in this portfolio.

### 🚨 Artifact 4 – Incident Response  
**Folder:** `Incident-Response`

**Deliverables:**
- `Case_Report.md`
- `Case_Report_Alexander_Ramos.pdf`
- `IR_Playbook.md`
- `IR_Tech_Simulation.md`

**Focus:** NIST 800-61 lifecycle, containment, recovery, and executive reporting.  
**Summary:** End-to-end incident simulation demonstrating all six phases of incident response — preparation, detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review — aligned with NIST 800-61 Rev. 2 guidance.

---

### 📨 Artifact 2 – Phishing Email Analysis  
**Folder:** `Phishing-Email-Analysis`

**Deliverables:**
- `Email_Investigation.md`
- `IOCs.csv`
- `Phishing_Report_Alexander_Ramos.pdf`

**Focus:** Threat identification, phishing analysis, and documentation.  
**Summary:** Analysis of a simulated phishing email to extract indicators of compromise, identify social engineering vectors, and communicate findings to technical and non-technical stakeholders.

---

### 🧠 Artifact 1 – SIEM Log Analysis  
**Folder:** `SIEM-Log-Analysis`

**Deliverables:**
- `Log_Investigation.md`
- `Queries.txt`
- `SIEM_Log_Analysis_Findings.pdf`

**Focus:** Splunk log ingestion, detection correlation, and SOC alert triage.  
**Summary:** Conducted log analysis and correlation using **Splunk**, developing custom queries and alerts for simulated threat activity, mimicking Tier I / Tier II SOC analyst responsibilities.

---

### ⚔️ Artifact 6 – SOC Incident Simulation  
**Folder:** `SOC-Incident-Simulation`

**Deliverables:**
- `SOC-Incident-Simulation.md`
- `SOC_Report_Alexander_Ramos.pdf`

**Focus:** SOC workflow integration, event correlation, and escalation.  
**Summary:** Synthesizes all previous artifacts into a single, continuous SOC simulation — correlating events from logs, phishing cases, and vulnerabilities to demonstrate cohesive response, documentation, and analysis.

---

### 🧾 Artifact 3 – Vulnerability Scan  
**Folder:** `Vulnerability-Scan`

**Deliverables:**
- `Remediation_Plan.md`
- `Vuln_Scan_Report.md`
- `Vuln_Scan_Results.pdf`
- `Vulnerability_Remediation_Plan_Alexander_Ramos.pdf`

**Focus:** Vulnerability identification, remediation, and validation.  
**Summary:** Executed a vulnerability assessment using **Nmap** and **Nikto**, documented findings, created a remediation plan, and verified mitigation results in a lab environment.
