# ðŸ§© Vulnerability Remediation Plan

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the remediation actions and priorities for the vulnerabilities identified during the network and host scan. The goal is to mitigate exploitable risks and strengthen the organizationâ€™s overall security posture.

---

## 2. Remediation Priorities
| Priority | Description | Target Completion |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **P1 â€“ Critical** | Patches or configurations addressing active exploits or unauthenticated access. | Within 24â€“48 hours |
| **P2 â€“ High** | Patches for vulnerabilities that could lead to privilege escalation or lateral movement. | Within 7 days |
| **P3 â€“ Medium** | Mitigations for vulnerabilities that require local access or social engineering. | Within 14â€“30 days |
| **P4 â€“ Low** | Cosmetic or low-risk configuration improvements. | Within 60 days |

## 3. Recommended Actions

### ðŸŸ¥ Critical
- **SMB Signing Disabled (CVE-2017-0144)**  
  - Disable SMBv1 protocol via Group Policy.  
  - Enforce SMB signing for all domain systems.  
  - Validate through post-remediation scan.  

### ðŸŸ§ High
- **Apache HTTPD Path Traversal (CVE-2021-41773)**  
  - Update Apache to version 2.4.52 or higher.  
  - Implement file path access controls.  
  - Conduct penetration testing after patching.

### ðŸŸ¨ Medium
- **Weak TLS Cipher Suites**  
  - Update web server configuration to support only TLS 1.2/1.3.  
  - Remove deprecated ciphers (RC4, 3DES).  
  - Validate with SSL Labs after change.

### ðŸŸ© Low
- **Missing Security Headers**  
  - Add `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Content-Security-Policy` to web applications.  
  - Validate headers via web scanner or browser dev tools.

## 4. Verification Steps
1. Perform follow-up vulnerability scan to confirm risk reduction.  
2. Document evidence of patch application and system hardening.  
3. Review logs for anomalies or failed patch attempts.  
4. Update vulnerability management dashboard accordingly.  

---

## 5. Lessons Learned
- Establish automated monthly scans.  
- Integrate patch management with change control.  
- Communicate remediation timelines to system owners.
