# ðŸ§© Vulnerability Scan Report

**Analyst:** Alexander T. Ramos  
**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Tools Used:** Nmap (service/version discovery, scripts) & Nikto (web scan) â€” plus manual validation (`nmap`, `telnet`, `nikto`, `nikto`)  
**Scan Target:** Metasploitable 2 (192.168.56.101)  
**Network Type:** Internal VirtualBox lab (host-only / isolated network)

---

## 1. Objective
Conduct a simulated internal vulnerability assessment against a lab target using open-source tooling (Nmap and Nikto), identify and prioritize exploitable findings, and produce remediation guidance suitable for vulnerability management workflows.

---

## 2. Environment Overview
| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Host System** | Windows 10 Pro laptop running VirtualBox (Primary Host) |
| **Scanner VM** | Kali Linux (running Nmap, Nikto, auxiliary tools) |
| **Target VM** | Metasploitable 2 (vulnerable Linux server) |
| **Network** | Internal/Host-Only VirtualBox network â€” isolated from production |
| **Scan Mode** | Combination of non-credentialed Nmap scans, targeted Nmap scripts, Nikto web scanning, and manual verification commands |

---

## 3. Scan Methodology
1. Performed reconnaissance and service discovery with `nmap -sS -sV -sC -p- 192.168.56.101`.  
2. Ran targeted Nmap NSE scripts for additional host/service checks (e.g., `--script ftp-backdoor`, `smb-os-discovery`).  
3. Executed web application checks with `nikto -h http://192.168.56.101` to enumerate web paths, headers, and common weaknesses.  
4. Exported scan excerpts and manually validated high-confidence findings using `nmap`, `telnet`, and browser checks.  
5. Prioritized vulnerabilities by severity and produced remediation steps based on best practices.

## 4. Key Findings (summary)

| Severity | Vulnerability / Symptom | Description / Evidence |
|---------:|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Critical** | vsftpd backdoor (remote shell) | Nmap service detection found `vsftpd 2.3.4 (backdoor)`; NSE ftp-backdoor script confirmed remote shell behavior. |
| **High** | Apache HTTPD 2.2.8 â€” path traversal / info disclosure | Nikto found default files, exposed headers and possible phpMyAdmin/admin pathsâ€”multiple published CVEs affect older Apache versions. |
| **High** | Samba (smbd) â€“ remote code execution vectors | Nmap and smb discovery indicated old Samba components with known remote exploit history. |
| **Medium** | MySQL weak/default credentials | Service responds on 3306; default credentials and weak auth likely present in this lab image. |
| **Low** | Missing security headers / weak TLS configuration | Nikto and header inspection show missing `X-Frame-Options` and other hardening headers; TLS/SSL support not robust.
