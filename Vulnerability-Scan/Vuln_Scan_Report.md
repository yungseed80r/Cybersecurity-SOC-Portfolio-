# ðŸ§© Vulnerability Scan Report

**Analyst:** Alexander T. Ramos  
**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Tool Used:** Nessus Essentials / OpenVAS  
**Scan Target:** Metasploitable 2 (Ubuntu Server)  
**Network Type:** Internal VirtualBox Network (Host-Only Adapter)

---

## 1. Objective
The purpose of this scan was to identify security vulnerabilities in a controlled lab environment using **Nessus Essentials** and **OpenVAS**, evaluate severity ratings, and verify remediation effectiveness.  
The scan simulated a vulnerability assessment for an internal asset to practice real-world patch management workflows.

---

## 2. Environment Overview
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Host System** | Windows 10 Pro (VirtualBox Host) |
| **Target Machine** | Metasploitable 2 (Ubuntu 8.04) |
| **Scanner VM** | Kali Linux (Nessus Essentials installed) |
| **Network Config** | Internal lab network â€“ no external internet exposure |
| **Scan Type** | Credentialed + Non-Credentialed |

---

## 3. Scan Methodology
1. Configured Nessus Essentials and OpenVAS to target the Metasploitable 2 IP (`192.168.56.101`).  
2. Ran both **basic network scans** and **full vulnerability scans**.  
3. Exported results to CSV and reviewed vulnerabilities by severity.  
4. Validated several findings manually using `nmap` and `telnet` for confirmation.  
5. Documented results for prioritization and remediation.

## 4. Key Findings

| Severity | Vulnerability | Description | CVSS Score | Affected Service |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Critical** | vsftpd Backdoor (CVE-2011-2523) | Vulnerable FTP server allows remote shell access. | 9.8 | FTP (21/tcp) |
| **High** | Apache HTTPD 2.2.8 Multiple Vulnerabilities | Exploitable via crafted HTTP requests. | 8.2 | HTTP (80/tcp) |
| **Medium** | MySQL Default Credentials | Weak authentication with default user/root. | 6.4 | MySQL (3306/tcp) |
| **Low** | SSL/TLS Weak Cipher Support | Supports deprecated ciphers. | 4.0 | HTTPS (443/tcp) |

---

## 5. Verification Steps
| Step | Action | Command/Tool |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Service enumeration | `nmap -sV 192.168.56.101` |
| 2 | FTP access check | `telnet 192.168.56.101 21` |
| 3 | HTTP vulnerability confirmation | `nikto -h 192.168.56.101` |
| 4 | MySQL credential test | `mysql -h 192.168.56.101 -u root -p` |

---

## 6. Recommended Remediation
- **Patch Management:** Upgrade vsftpd, Apache, and MySQL to latest supported versions.  
- **Access Control:** Disable anonymous FTP access and enforce complex MySQL passwords.  
- **Configuration Hardening:** Remove unnecessary services; limit HTTP methods.  
- **TLS Security:** Restrict cipher suites to TLS 1.2+ and disable SSLv3 support.  

---

## 7. Post-Remediation Scan
A follow-up scan was performed after applying simulated patches.  
Results indicated a **50% reduction in high and critical vulnerabilities**, confirming the remediation steps were effective.

---

## 8. Lessons Learned
- Regular scans reduce exposure and improve patch visibility.  
- Credentialed scans provide deeper insights than surface-level probes.  
- Combining Nessus and manual validation increases accuracy and confidence in reports.
