### ðŸ§° Artifact 3 â€“ Vulnerability Scan

**Objective:**  
Perform a vulnerability assessment on the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine to identify exploitable services, evaluate risk severity, and simulate an analystâ€™s reporting process using open-source scanning tools.

**Tools Used:**  
Kali Linux (Nmap + Nikto)  
Splunk (for log review and correlation)

**Deliverables:**  
- [Vuln_Scan_Report.md](./Vulnerability-Scan/Vuln_Scan_Report.md)  
- [Vuln_Scan_results.pdf](./Vulnerability-Scan/Vuln_Scan_results.pdf)  
- [Vulnerability_Remediation_Plan_Alexander_Ramos.pdf](./Vulnerability-Scan/Vulnerability_Remediation_Plan_Alexander_Ramos.pdf)

**Summary:**  
This simulated scan used *Nmap* for port and service discovery and *Nikto* for web application vulnerability enumeration. Results revealed multiple critical and high-severity findings including a vulnerable `vsftpd` service with a known backdoor, Apache path traversal exposure, and outdated Samba configurations. Remediation recommendations included patching, service hardening, and revalidation via credentialed follow-up scans.

> *This exercise demonstrates hands-on familiarity with vulnerability assessment methodology, report generation, and translating technical findings into actionable remediation steps.*
