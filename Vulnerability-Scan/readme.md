### 3. Vulnerability Scan

**Objective:**  
Conduct a vulnerability assessment and document the findings, remediation actions, and verification steps performed in a controlled lab environment.

**Artifacts:**  
- ðŸ“„ [Vuln_Scan_Report.md](./Vulnerability-Scan/Vuln_Scan_Report.md)  
- ðŸ“Š [Vuln_Scan_results.pdf](./Vulnerability-Scan/Vuln_Scan_results.pdf)  
- ðŸ§¾ [Vulnerability_Remediation_Plan_Alexander_Ramos.pdf](./Vulnerability-Scan/Vulnerability_Remediation_Plan_Alexander_Ramos.pdf)

**Summary:**  
This artifact demonstrates the ability to identify, analyze, and mitigate vulnerabilities within a simulated environment using open-source tools such as **Nmap**, **Nikto**, and **Splunk**.  
It highlights a structured methodology for vulnerability management â€” discovery, prioritization, remediation, and validation â€” consistent with NIST and SOC best practices.
